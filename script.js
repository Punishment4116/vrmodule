More specifically, it will keep track of how much the player has turned on his or her Y axis. If you don't understand radians, don't worry, they're pretty simple: 360 degrees = 2 PI radians (or about 6.28 radians); 180 degrees = PI radians; 90 degrees = PI/2 radians; etc.)

You can think of a vector as the hypotenuse of a right triangle.  A vector's components are simply the other two sides of the right triangle (more below).  In other words, vector components/sides allow us to more easily work with diagonal things (e.g. diagonal movements, diagonal velocities, etc.).  Vectors are the main building blocks of every physics engine!
